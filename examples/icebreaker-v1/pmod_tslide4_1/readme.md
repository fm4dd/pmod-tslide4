# Design Notes

This is a test program to verify the correct function of the tslide4 PMOD.
It assumes a TSlide4 PMOD connected to IceBreaker PMOD2 connector, and a
8LED2 PMOD connected to PMOD1A and PMOD1B connectors.

The design links the four slide switches with LED D1-D4 in green color,
and the four push button switches with LED D5-D8 in red color.

Operating the switches simply turns the corresponding LED on or off.
